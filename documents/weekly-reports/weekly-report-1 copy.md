1. What did I do this week?
-Come up with the topic and algorithms 
2. How has the program progressed?
-I havent yet coded anything
3. What did I learn this week/today?
- I read up on the topic of genetic algorithms and Q-learning to be ready to start implementing them.
4. What remains unclear or has been challenging?
        Answer this honestly, as you can receive help based on your response.
I think I have a pretty good idea of what to start coding, the bioreactor code first, then starting to implement the algorithms one by one.
5. What will I do next?
Start coding the bioreactor base simulation code along with the dynamic programming algorithm.
