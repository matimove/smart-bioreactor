1. What did I do this week?
-Code the base code for the bioreactor update with differential equations
2. How has the program progressed?
- It is starting to progress more now than in previous weeks.
3. What did I learn this week/today?
- I learned about growth kinetic modeling and about general project structure
4. What remains unclear or has been challenging?
        Answer this honestly, as you can receive help based on your response.
Right now there is no challenging parts as I am yet to implement the main simulation algorithms.
5. What will I do next?
Start coding the dynamic programming algorithm and add basic graph visualization for next week to be able visualize results.
